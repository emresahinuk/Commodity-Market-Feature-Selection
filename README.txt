This project aims to find highly correlated variables to create a predictive equation for the output variable of monthly average electricity prices (kw/h) of the UK. We will explore two input variables as a demonstration, which are, monthly average prices of crude oil per barrel and natural gas per gallon. The walkthrough is available within each section of the notebook. Below is the link to the demo which showcases the multicolloniarity assessment and outlier eradication within variables;
